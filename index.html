        <h2>Why Pediatric Dentistry Matters</h2>
        <p>Pediatric dentistry focuses on dental care for infants, children, and teens.

Choosing a qualified <a href="https://share.google/HKY63LfDEMCTIgeaa">dentist in Austin, TX</a> ensures your child gets the right care at the right time — from routine cleanings to more complex treatments like sealants and fluoride therapy.</p>
